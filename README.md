# Coloured_linegame
Colored Lines is a Python-based puzzle game using Tkinter. It is played on a 9×9 grid where the player moves colored balls to form straight lines of five or more matching balls. Formed lines are removed and scored, while new random balls appear. The game ends when the grid is full.
